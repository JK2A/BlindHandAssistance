Won: Best Accessibility Hack (JP Morgan), Best use of Google Cloud (Google)

An open-sourced project built at TAMUHack 2020 with the goal of assisting visually impaired individuals in their daily life. 

This project uses the Google Cloud API (speech <-> text) and Tensorflow 2. Built completely in Python3, this project can run on a CPU with minimal lag. 

Using this tool, visually impaired people can use their hands as a substitute for their eyes, and vocally inform the system what they are looking for. The audio pipeline will then emit a sequence of beeps with a frequency corresponding to the distance between the individuals hand and the desired object.
